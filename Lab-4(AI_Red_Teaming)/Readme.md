## 🧠 Overview

In this lab, you'll explore **Azure AI's Red Teaming tools** to evaluate how well your language models handle adversarial inputs and edge-case prompts. This is essential for ensuring the **robustness, safety, and reliability** of AI systems in real-world deployments.

Unlike basic evaluation tasks, red teaming simulates **malicious user behavior** and tests how your model responds under pressure using **multiple attack strategies** and **risky prompt categories**.

## 📘 What You Will Learn

- ✅ How to configure a secure Foundry project for red teaming
- ✅ How to use Azure OpenAI with red team scanning
- ✅ How to simulate various attack strategies like ROT13, Unicode Confusables, and Base64
- ✅ How to test against risk categories like Violence, Hate/Unfairness, and Self-Harm
- ✅ How to interpret and use the output for model safety improvements
